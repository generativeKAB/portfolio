  <h2>Artist Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>My work finished work never calls for aesthetic over-polishing, and resists all expectations put on us artists to create  appealing or easily consumable work. Instead, I create sculpture, assemblage, and interactive installations that hold space in the thresholds between the known and the unknown. These liminal states are fragile, shifting, unresolved, while containing limitless potential. This is where where I locate meaning. My study of affect theory and the Deleuzian idea of becoming, have accompanied me in my pursuits as both observer and creator- seeking to open experience rather than stifle it with answers. I want those who encounter my work not to consume it, but to linger with it, to sense a pull toward something unfamiliar. My practice is an invitation: to dwell in ambiguity, to touch what escapes language, and to glimpse possibility in the in-between.

“A becoming is neither one nor two, nor the relation of the two; it is the in-between, the border or line of flight. It is the in-between that makes the two.” </em> — Deleuze &amp; Guattari, <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em></p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>My teaching philosophy emphasizes student discovery, process over product, and empathy through art. I design lessons that invite risk-taking, reflection, and connection across disciplines.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sample Lesson: Exploring texture through found-object sculpture.</li>
      <li>Sample Unit: Understanding emotion in music performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="research">
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>My research explores arts integration, student agency through process documentation, and the evolving role of the teaching artist in education. I focus on how creativity fosters empathy, reflection, and cultural connection.</p>
